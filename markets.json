Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No.”\n\nThis market may resolve to \"Yes\" immediately after the statement from the Fed's December 2025 meeting has been released if there has been exactly 6 rate cuts by then.\n\nFor example, if the FED cuts rates by 50 bps after a meeting, it would be considered 2 cuts (of 25 bps each). If there are 7 or more rate cuts at any point before this market's resolution date, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nNote that cuts between 1-24 bps (inclusive) will also be considered 1 rate cut.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be FOMC statements after meetings scheduled in 2025 according to the official calendar: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm. The level and change of the target federal funds rate is also published at the official website of the Federal Reserve at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm.","outcomes":"[\"Yes\", \"No\"]","outcomePrices":"[\"0.0025\", \"0.9975\"]","volume":"1894785.177623","active":true,"closed":false,"marketMakerAddress":"","createdAt":"2024-12-29T20:36:57.617602Z","updatedAt":"2025-10-10T20:05:44.61949Z","new":false,"featured":false,"submitted_by":"0x91430CaD2d3975766499717fA0D66A78D814E5c5","archived":false,"resolvedBy":"0x2F5e3684cb1F318ec51b00Edba38d79Ac2c0aA9d","restricted":true,"groupItemTitle":"6 (150 bps)","groupItemThreshold":"6","questionID":"0x1bdcc22f99efd4a0af525806c64f7e6ee0a1640517b1d0a4a731367b6554be06","enableOrderBook":true,"orderPriceMinTickSize":0.001,"orderMinSize":5,"volumeNum":1894785.177623,"liquidityNum":249729.36222,"endDateIso":"2025-12-10","startDateIso":"2024-12-29","hasReviewedDates":true,"volume24hr":173799.008,"volume1wk":245612.16724900005,"volume1mo":430928.9362059999,"volume1yr":1892943.6487900012,"clobTokenIds":"[\"35428628589990747181456921610814206632405028717182760412162159083085892664954\", \"33673334616268013961585301204311121178127515047580027207826322300546567181423\"]","umaBond":"500","umaReward":"5","volume24hrClob":173799.008,"volume1wkClob":245612.16724900005,"volume1moClob":430928.9362059999,"volume1yrClob":1892943.6487900012,"volumeClob":1894785.177623,"liquidityClob":249729.36222,"acceptingOrders":true,"negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x1bdcc22f99efd4a0af525806c64f7e6ee0a1640517b1d0a4a731367b6554be00","negRiskRequestID":"0x033b2dbd0328eea8a2a302be05efbc501aaf3312be1bec02404fbb49745ec831","events":[{"id":"16085","ticker":"how-many-fed-rate-cuts-in-2025","slug":"how-many-fed-rate-cuts-in-2025","title":"How many Fed rate cuts in 2025?","description":"This is a market group over how many Fed rate cuts will happen in 2025.","resolutionSource":"","startDate":"2024-12-29T22:50:43.348587Z","creationDate":"2024-12-29T22:50:43.348584Z","endDate":"2025-12-31T12:00:00Z","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-fed-rate-cuts-in-2025-9qstZkSL1dn0.jpg","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-fed-rate-cuts-in-2025-9qstZkSL1dn0.jpg","active":true,"closed":false,"archived":false,"new":false,"featured":false,"restricted":true,"liquidity":1002749.08894,"volume":19071519.65457,"openInterest":0,"createdAt":"2024-12-29T17:39:19.350409Z","updatedAt":"2025-10-10T20:08:06.485662Z","competitive":0.9596698735634942,"volume24hr":226286.299191,"volume1wk":966428.8188840002,"volume1mo":3763331.510859,"volume1yr":19051547.912263006,"enableOrderBook":true,"liquidityClob":1002749.08894,"negRisk":true,"negRiskMarketID":"0x1bdcc22f99efd4a0af525806c64f7e6ee0a1640517b1d0a4a731367b6554be00","commentCount":92,"cyom":false,"showAllOutcomes":true,"showMarketImages":false,"enableNegRisk":true,"automaticallyActive":true,"gmpChartMode":"default","negRiskAugmented":false,"pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false}],"ready":false,"funded":false,"acceptingOrdersTimestamp":"2024-12-29T22:47:17Z","cyom":false,"competitive":0.8015991903848178,"pagerDutyNotificationEnabled":false,"approved":true,"rewardsMinSize":200,"rewardsMaxSpread":3.5,"spread":0.001,"oneWeekPriceChange":-0.0035,"oneMonthPriceChange":-0.01,"lastTradePrice":0.003,"bestBid":0.002,"bestAsk":0.003,"automaticallyActive":true,"clearBookOnStart":true,"seriesColor":"","showGmpSeries":false,"showGmpOutcome":false,"manualActivation":false,"negRiskOther":false,"umaResolutionStatuses":"[]","pendingDeployment":false,"deploying":false,"rfqEnabled":false,"holdingRewardsEnabled":false,"feesEnabled":false},{"id":"516734","question":"Will SpaceX have between 120-139 launches in 2025?","conditionId":"0x72a1acd43d83a9e254d00648b84c135fe7eae01929d97818160a3626f664c043","slug":"will-spacex-have-between-120-139-launches-in-2025","resolutionSource":"https://www.faa.gov/data_research/commercial_space_data","endDate":"2025-12-31T12:00:00Z","liquidity":"2996.59103","startDate":"2024-12-30T15:43:50.177885Z","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-spacex-launches-in-2025-H9bLc6Yotwva.jpg","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how-many-spacex-launches-in-2025-H9bLc6Yotwva.jpg","description":"This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if SpaceX has between 120 (inclusive) and 139 (inclusive) launches in 2025.
